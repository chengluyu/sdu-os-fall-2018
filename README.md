## Submission Guide

> The content of this is no longer applicable since **Jan 21th 2019 01:30 GMT+8 (China Standard Time)**.

You need to fork this repoistory and [keep it up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).

### How to Submit Work Progress

The first time you submit your work progress, you should create a markdown file in `progress` folder. For the sake of anonymity, **the filename should be same as your GitHub ID**. 

After the first time, what you need to do is just appending your work progress to that file.

After commiting your work progress to your fork, create a pull request against this repository.

You **must** append your work progress **before each Tuesday** since National Holiday **until the final presentation**. Your submission will influence your final grade.

### How to Submit Your Report

Just put your report (**PDF format**, other format will be rejected) in `report` folder. **The filename should be same as your GitHub ID**.

After commiting your report to your fork, create a pull request against this repository.

### How to Submit Your Final Work

In the end of this course, you must submit your final work (source code and result generated by your code).

**Don't put your final work in this repoistory directly.** Instead, you are expected to create your own repository, then clone it into the `code` folder, [making it a submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v1/Git-%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7-%E5%AD%90%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97).

After commiting your final work to your fork, create a pull request against this repository.
